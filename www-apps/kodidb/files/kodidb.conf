# The correct way to update a package installed with emerge is simply to reemerge
# the package. If you wish to use the built in webupdater you will need to pull
# the git source to a seperate dir and change code_dir to reflect changes
# ie.
# git clone https://github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard.git /opt/kodidb
# set below to CODE_DIR=/opt/kodidb
WEBUPDATER="NO"
